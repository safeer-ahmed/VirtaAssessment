# VirtaAssessment

Thoughts upon developing this template:

* Typescript is used to achieve static typing which results in better code management and scalability.
* Considering reusability, custom components are developed which can be used across the app and can be customised as required.
* A common method for API call is used along with parametrization technique to achieve.
* Theming is kept separate to support dark/light theme easily.
